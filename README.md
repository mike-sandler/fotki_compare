Compare files from fotki.com with local copies

Fotki.com has gotten bad as of late (last few years) forcing me to finally take my pictures (and business) elsewhere.
Unfortunately part of the problem is the unreliable FTP retrieval of originals.

This script can be used to compare the names and sizes of remote files (on ftp.fotki.com) with their local counterparts, pointing out missing files and size discrepancies.  The result can be fed into a download attempt.  Lather, rinse, repeat until the number of missing files is low enough (I was unable to achieve 0, unfortunately, meaning fotki lost some of my pictures).
